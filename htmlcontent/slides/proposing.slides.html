                    <li style="font-size:0.68em;">NSPIRES is a great resource for dual-anonymous compliance. You can consult the <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=736703/solicitationId=%7B4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/Guidelines%20for%20Anonymous%20Proposals%20DAPR%20Doc%20Astro%20GO%20Programs.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals</a> PDF document for specific instructions.

                    <br>
                    <li style="font-size:0.68em;"> The "Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals" document also contains complete information on how to write the required "Expertise and Resources - Not Anonymized" document.</li>

                <h2>How do I make my proposal dual-anonymous compliant (cont)?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:0.6em;">When writing the anonymous part of your Phase-1 proposal, make sure to eliminate language that identifies you or your institution. For example, instead of using "...as we demonstrated in Smith et al. (2022)..." you can instead use "...as demonstrated by [1]...", and then put [1] into the reference list. Another example of compliance issue could be "...we have guaranteed time on our 1.5-m campus telescope at the University of Maryland...". Instead, you can say "...we have guaranteed time on a 1.5-m telescope..." and then describe the facility in the "Expertise and Resources - Not Anonymized" part of the Phase-1 proposal.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li style="font-size:0.6em;">Speaking of references, they should always be in a [1], [2], [3] format in the main body of the proposal.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:0.6em;">NASA understands that dual-anonymous peer review represents a major shift in the evaluation of proposals, and as such there may be occasional slips in writing anonymized proposals.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li style="font-size:0.6em;">However, NASA reserves the right to return without review proposals that are particularly egregious in terms of the identification of the proposing team. </li>

                <h2>How do I submit a proposal?</h2>
                <p style="font-size:0.68em;">It depends on what category you are interested in. The differences are as follows</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:0.68em;"> The TESS GI program uses a two-step proposal process. Phase-1 presents the scientific/technical justification. If a Phase-1 proposal is accepted and requests funding, a Phase-2 budget justification is required. All proposal materials are submitted electronically through the <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/rps/" target="_blank">ARK/RPS portal </a>. </li>
                    <br>

                    <li style="font-size:0.6em;">The panel will validate the qualifications of the team in order to allow the reviewers to assess the team capabilities required to execute a given proposed science investigation.</li>
