                magnetic activity cycles in many of the brightest stars in the sky. These unique data help to place the
                solar cycle in context, but the fundamental properties of the stars have large uncertainties. To better
                characterize the evolution of stellar cycles, we propose to determine asteroseismic masses and ages for
                a sample of stars with long magnetic activity time-series. Rotation is thought to be a key ingredient in
                stellar dynamos. With TESS we can also obtain independent constraints on the stellar rotation periods.
                These measurements will allow us to test the recent hypothesis that magnetic dynamos are disrupted in
                middle-aged stars, and that stellar cycles grow longer as stars age and rotate slower.

                needed to construct stellar models, but it strongly affects a star's structure and subsequent evolution.
                Helium cannot be detected in the photosphere of most stars. Asteroseismology allows us to determine the

                frequencies, and directly by looking at the acoustic glitch signal of helium ionization. Stars in the

                time, and are seldom sampled well enough to model properly over a single orbital cycle. Folding the time

                and neutron stars (NSs) in binary systems with MS stars. Specifically, we propose to look for the
                periodic magnification of the MS star caused by gravitational lensing by the BH or NS companion, which
                leads to an increase in flux on the order of 100--1000 ppm, lasting a few hours. Thus TESS is the ideal
                instrument for this search technique. We estimate that TESS will be able to detect and measure the
                masses of ~20 BHs and ~50 NSs with better than ~10% accuracy. Mass lower limits will be measured for
                over 200 systems, increasing the known population of galactic black holes by an order of magnitude.

                photometry of the 2.7 Myr old star CVSO 30 revealed transit-like dips in flux with a short period of
                only 0.45 d. While strongly reminiscent of planetary transits, the observed flux dips change in shape
                and occasionally even appear to vanish. This challenges an interpretation in terms of a planet. Existing

                calibration-quality EBs, where simulations predict a 10-fold increase in the number of known EBs; and
                (3) acquire 2-min cadence observations for a prioritized list of targets that maximize scientific yield.
                The proposal discusses hot topics in the EB field and outlines the effort to provide these deliverables
                to the community.

                stars allow us to probe post-helium flash and helium-fusing cores. GAIA will provide distances and
                radii, TESS seismology will provide core masses and internal structure across differing evolutionary
                paths. Our proposal has 3 main objectives: 1) determine evolutionary core mass sequences of horizontal
                branch stars. 2) Determine angular momentum evolution across the helium flash and between interacting
                binaries; and 3) characterize radially differential rotation as a probe of core-envelope interactions.

                direct consequence of the presence of giant planetary companions. Lambda Bootis stars are A-type stars
                that were found to exhibit an under-abundance of Fe-peak elements while their abundances of lighter
                elements are normal. One possible scenario to explain these abundance patterns is that young lambda
                Bootis stars selectively accrete material from the circumstellar disk which is dynamically separated by
                the presence of a massive planetary companion. Our proposed study will test this hypothesis.

                planets in Year-1 alone. Importantly, each TOCS planet will have well known physical properties,

                An expanded population of cluster planets will also provide much needed guidance to N-body modelers

                previously unknown feature in the magnetic dynamo evolution of young, cool dwarfs. This will be achieved
                by measuring rotation periods from TESS FFIs for stars at a range of galactic positions. Secondly, we
                will calibrate the gyrochronology relations at old ages using TESS-HERMES spectra and Gaia proper
                motions. We will also quantify the precision and accuracy of gyrochronology using Gaia comoving pairs.
                Finally, we will provide a catalog of ~ 1 million rotation periods for TESS FFI stars.

                atmospheric and biosignature detection in transiting planets because of the enhanced feature contrast in
                transit and eclipse spectroscopy. We propose a pilot TESS survey to continuously monitor six of the
                brightest ultra-cool dwarfs over 27.4 days. To maximize the probability of detecting transiting planets,
                we have selected only targets seen close to equator-on. Spin-orbit alignment expectations dictate that
                the planetary systems around these ultra-cool dwarfs should also be oriented nearly edge-on. Any planet
                detections in our pilot survey will immediately become top priority targets for JWST transit

                related to how well we know their host stars. There are few well-characterised M-dwarfs that can be used
                to establish an empirical relation. As such, investigation of planets orbiting M-dwarfs will be
                frustrated. The low mass eclipsing binary (EBLM) program has measured the masses and, characterised over

                Hot subdwarfs (HSDs) are peculiar stars that lost almost all their envelope near the tip of the RGB. The

                year of operations. We propose to observe 3945 white dwarfs brighter than 18th magnitude and analyze the
                light curves for evidence of transiting planets (including disintegrating examples) from the TESS data
                set.

                solar cycle in context, but the fundamental stellar properties still have large uncertainties. To better
                characterize the evolution of stellar cycles, we propose to determine asteroseismic masses and ages for
                a sample of late F- and early G-type stars with existing magnetic activity time-series. Rotation is
                thought to be a key ingredient in stellar dynamos. With TESS we can also obtain measurements of rotation
                for F-type stars. These observations will allow us to test the recent suggestion that magnetic dynamos
                are disrupted in middle-aged stars, and that stellar cycles grow longer as stars age and rotate slower.

              <div class="accordion-body">"Superhumps" are periodic photometric waves in the light curves of compact
                stars accreting through a disk. They seem to arise from eccentric and wobble instabilities at the 3:1
                resonance in accretion disks, and always produce a periodic signal several percent displaced from the
                orbital period. Several harmonics and sidebands of that primary signal are probably also present, but
                have never been clearly mapped out, due to inevitable interruptions in ground-based coverage. Our four
                targets for TESS coverage are the only cataclysmic variables which show both types of precession
                (apsidal and disk-wobble), and cry out for very long time series, which will elucidate the precise
                period structure, and relation between the two frequencies.

                during their time-travel (Guiglion et al. 2019). Using TESS light curves of 15 selected dwarfs stars (6
                of them are super-solar), we plan to derive precise masses, radius and ages, and well as atmospheric
                parameters and refined lithium abundances from ESO HARPS spectra. If such metal-rich stars are confirmed
                to be old, this would reinforce the fact that they migrated from the inner-disc, giving additional

                For planets orbiting within the habitable zone of low-mass stars, these effects can be magnified due to
                their proximity to the host star. We propose TESS two-minute light curves of the targets that will be
                observed by the NASA-funded Star-Planet Research CubeSat (SPARCS) to resolve the short-lived flares
                (typical lifetimes of a few hours), quantify the optical stellar rotational variability, and determine
                the flare-frequency distribution. There are 7 SPARCS target stars that will be observed by TESS in Cycle
                2. The TESS and SPARCS data will provide multi-wavelength flare frequency distributions, rotational
                modulation, and total flare energies that will enable new scaling laws between the optical and UV.

                stars, hiding the key bound region of a planet's exosphere. High radial velocity stars offer a solution,

                we can now measure model-independent parameters for M dwarfs eclipsing higher-mass stars (spectral types

                least one M dwarf component to precisely measure the primary and secondary eclipses. The 2-minute
                cadence is necessary for resolving the ingress and egress shapes to the requisite precision to measure

                Hot subdwarfs (HSDs) are peculiar stars that lost almost all their envelope near the tip of the RGB. The
                envelope ejection may be related to common envelope (CE) evolution and indeed 50% of these stars are in

                ages are among the most difficult to measure properties of stars. Accurate ages provide leverage on
                problems ranging from exoplanet habitability to the Galaxy's chemical evolution and age. Gyrochronology,
                an empirical relation between rotation and age, is believed to be among the best current methods of
                stellar age determination. We propose to test several competing gyrochronology models using wide
                binaries in the TESS fields. Such pairs can help unravel and quantify the rotation-activity-metallicity
                vs. age relations for main sequence stars. They span a much broader range in age and metallicity than
                stellar clusters, which often have mixed populations and have lost low mass stars.

                (demonstrated <1m /s), to which the PI has full, dedicated access. These long-baseline, simultaneous
                  time-series will be a unique and unprecedented dataset for us to develop and refine methods to model
                  the stellar RV signals that currently hamper planet detection. This data and analysis toolkit---which
                  will be made available publicly---will be crucial to ensure that continuing improvements of RV
                  instruments result in confirmation of the smallest TESS planets and detections of lower-mass planets

                  Their magnetic activity is driven by rotation and convection, evolves over time, and is manifested in

                core-collapse supernovae. However, a major shortcoming of stellar evolution models is their large
                uncertainties for interior rotation and convective core overshooting. This is because we lack detailed
                observational constraints on massive star interiors. Fortunately, most massive stars pulsate in gravity
                and pressure modes, which are extremely sensitive to a star's interior physics. The TESS mission is
                providing the first long-term and high-precision photometric data set for a large sample of massive
                stars. In this project, asteroseismology applied to 2-min TESS light curves will allow us to mitigate

              <div class="accordion-body">Metallic-line A (Am) stars show abundance anomalies produced by diffusive
                settling and radiative levitation which should reduce the He abundance in the pulsation driving region
                and inhibit pulsations. Nevertheless, many Am stars show gamma Dor, delta Sct, and higher frequency
                roAp-star like modes, and some also show magnetic activity. Neither the pulsation driving mechanisms,
                nor the origin of the magnetic fields or abundance anomalies are well understood. This proposal is a
                follow-on to our TESS Cycle 2 proposal, for which 2-min cadence data is being taken on Am stars having
                detailed spectroscopic abundance determinations. For Cycle 3, we propose to extend observations to 49
                additional chemically-peculiar stars to provide a definitive set of constraints to address these
                problems.

                be the prototype of a new class of pulsation-induced X-ray variables." Our objective is to determine

                Orbital stability demands that moons will be sufficiently short period that their associated TTV signal
                will always be above the Nyquist frequency (undersampled). Our new work shows that exomoons appear as
                longer period TTV aliases, piling up close to the Nyquist frequency, unlike planet-planet TTV signals
                that are preferentially longer period. We identify 63 Southern TOIs capable of hosting potentially
                detectable moons using TESS, which we will analyze with this approach to identify exomoon candidates for
                follow-up.

                  detection and characterization, however, is very challenging due to their longer periods (which makes

                  mission, which we will couple with radial-velocity measurements to characterize the masses and
                  architectures of these exciting systems. This will allow us to put strong constraints on the theories
                  of giant planet formation, and provide to the community exciting new systems to characterize with HST

                comparable to the burst recurrence timescales. The X-ray bursts are accompanied by optical bursts from
                reprocesing in the outer accretion disks, and with the 20-second cadence capability on TESS, it is
                finally possible to detect the bursts for a large sample of neutron stars. Here we propose to measure

                have selected a sample of 2573 objects enriched in BHs that exhibit large RV variations in LAMOST, SDSS,
                and Gaia data. We would like to use their TESS light curves to search for low-amplitude periodic
                photometric variations due to ellipsoidal modulation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. By
                combining the currently available radial velocity data and TESS photometry we will be able to create a
                large sample of BH candidates in non-interacting binary systems, which we will follow up to confirm
                their nature.

                constraining the processes of solar and stellar flares governing magnetic reconnection. Stellar
                atmospheres contain a plethora of waves such as QPPs and acoustic oscillations. The occurrence of

                magnetospheric structure and surface spots. Detecting pulsations will provide a means to link surface
                magnetism to the internal structure and better understand surface spindown due to magnetic braking,
                yielding critical information for stellar evolution models. Given its high precision, rapid cadence and
                long temporal baseline, TESS provides us with a unique opportunity to detect all three forms of
                variability, which will prove critical in testing and improving our knowledge of these stars.

                resource for measuring accurate RG masses thanks to the scaling relations that connect a star's
                characteristic oscillation frequencies to its surface gravity and mean density. We are undertaking a
                spectroscopic study of ~150 RGs to explore the relationship between planet hosting RGs and RGs with
                unusual properties suggestive of planet engulfment. We request resources to measure asteroseismic masses
                for the field RGs in our study that are covered by TESS, utilizing full frame images. Having accurate
                masses will allow us to assess whether our stellar samples are drawn from the same underlying mass

                NEID, simulatneously with TESS observations. A joint photometry-RV model will be used to mitigate
                activity in RVs, and provide precise mass estimates for our targets. Models will be run with Kepler
                photometry, TESS photometry, and both, with a study of the effectiveness of such models being a primary
                science result. The results of this project will inform future efforts to measure exoplanet masses with

                light curve morphologies that may signal shock breakout, companion star/circumstellar interaction, or an
                unusual nickel distribution. Despite the unique role of TESS, to maximize its science ground-based data
                must accompany it. Here we will provide discovery data and complete ground-based follow-up of the
                nearest SNe that will be in TESS Cycle 4 (5-7 SNe total), and will utilize new tools to
                spectroscopically classify SNe minutes after discovery. This array of follow-up data, including a single

                2-minute cadence observations to systematically measure asteroseismic ages for young moving groups,
                using a newly discovered class of high-frequency delta Scuti stars with regular frequency spacings. Our
                program will yield the first systematic asteroseismic age determination of young moving groups, probe
                the dynamical architectures of young stars through spin-axis inclination measurements, and shed light on
                the occurrence rate of delta Scuti stars with regular spacings.

              <div class="accordion-body">Prior to the era of regular space-based photometry, oscillations in solar-like
                stars were detectable only through heroic radial-velocity efforts from the ground or, in a handful of
                cases, from earlier space missions such as WIRE, MOST, and CoRoT. In contrast, Kepler allowed us to
                determine fundamental asteroseismic parameters for hundreds of main sequence stars as well as thousands
                of red giants. However, despite these successes, a gap remains at the bottom of the main sequence in the
                asteroseismic HR diagram. Here we propose to attempt to fill that gap using TESS 20-s cadence data from
                a large group of M dwarfs. TESS is ideally suited to photometric detection of M dwarf oscillations due
                to its unique combination of red sensitivity and short observing cadence.

                precise radial velocity (PRV) measurements; fewer than 10 such systems are currently known. Having
                simultaneous and complementary TTV and PRV observations leads to tighter constraints on the masses,

                frustrated by poor constraints on the host M-dwarfs. We aim to solve this with 161 eclipsing binaries
                comprised of F/G + M stars, all with 11+ years of spectroscopy to unveil masses and metallicities. We
                now require TESS short cadence light curves to obtain primary and secondary eclipses, and hence measure
                the radius and temperature. We request 2-minute observations and funding such that we can develop the
                most comprehensive sample of M-dwarfs known, significantly refine the empirical

                  objects, of which 40 have shown outbursts, which are not well understood. Recent studies that include
                  more data and exclude upper limits have shown that the relation Porb and superoutburst duration is

              <div class="accordion-body">Sun-like stars are born with relatively rapid rotation and strong magnetic
                fields. Through a process known as magnetic braking, the rotation slows over time as stellar winds
                gradually remove angular momentum from the system. Recent observations suggest that the efficiency of
                magnetic braking may decrease dramatically in stars near the middle of their main-sequence lifetimes.
                One hypothesis to explain these observations is a shift in magnetic complexity from predominantly larger
                to smaller spatial scales. By combining asteroseismology from TESS with ground-based spectropolarimetry,
                we propose to constrain the timing and duration of the shift in magnetic complexity for a carefully
                selected sample of stars that are near or beyond the middle of their main-sequence lifetimes.

              <div class="accordion-body">Exoplanet searches have typically focused on main sequence stars. Direct
                imaging has probed young planets, but what about the other extreme: planets around highly evolved stars?
                Only one planet has been found transiting a white dwarf. Searches have avoided binary stars due to fear
                of a diluted signal. However, secular interactions with a binary companion may be the only way of
                obtaining a short period planet around a white dwarf. We have carefully constructed a sample of white
                dwarfs in binaries, for which we have a planet-finding sensitivity on either the white dwarf or its main
                sequence companion. We predict roughly 5 discoveries in 3500 binaries. Any individual discovery with
                bear significance, and we will interpret our results in the context of planetary dynamics and stellar
                evolution.

                stars. Its spectrum is unique and spectacular, displaying broad emission lines of five-times ionized
                oxygen. The line widths suggest a wind expanding at 16000 km/s, more than 5% of the speed of light. The
                wind is seen to have density fluctuations that vary on a times scale of minutes and there are overall
                brightness changes at the 5% level. In the future, as the wind removes angular momentum from the merged
                white dwarfs, the remnant may reach a critical density and explode as a supernova. This program proposes
                to search for the spin frequency of the merger using the 20-sec cadence of TESS. The star's magnetic
                field may couple its rotation to the wind resulting in a persistent, but weak, photometric signal.

              <div class="accordion-body">Eclipsing binaries (EBs) provide benchmark measurements of stellar masses and
                radii that are the foundation of theoretical stellar astrophysics. Large areas of parameter space remain
                poorly constrained by observations, however, particularly at low masses and young ages. From the few
                sources that have been studied in this regime, models have been unable to simultaneously describe their
                observed properties (M, R, T, L). A thorough test of models requires a sample of EBs that spans both
                mass and age. TESS provides the first dataset capable of finding EBs on this scale. We therefore propose
                for targeted 2-m cadence observations of 40 young EB (10-700 Myr) discovered by our team in Cycle 2 and
                for 4157 young association members that will receive their first TESS observations in Cycle 4.

                closely-orbiting small companions to HJs. We have already conducted a small-scale search for these
                companions in the available Cycle 1 TESS 2-minute cadence data, finding no new planets, but only a
                fraction of every known HJ system was observed at this cadence. We propose to observe all Cycle 5 HJs
                with TESS's 2-minute cadence in a search for small nearby companions that could help constrain the
                formation mechanism of HJ systems and calculate the multiplicity rate of this unique planet population.
                This would generate the first complete and uniform data set of HJ systems down to the precision of TESS,

                This phenomenon can heavily bias rotation-based ages for low-mass K and M dwarfs. We propose to conduct

                owing to TESS's 20 second cadence. For exoplanetary science our predicted 10-20 discoveries will probe
                how the evolution of planets connects with that of their stars, including classic white dwarf signatures
                such as heavy element pollution. For stellar physics our sample will permit calibration of stellar age

                and abundance of rocky planets. The promise of M-dwarfs has led to a huge time and money commitment,
                including from TESS. The sometimes overlooked challenge is that low-mass stars flare frequently and at
                high amplitude. This not only hinders the detection and characterization of planets and stars, but it
                endangers any potential life. We propose a unique test of M-dwarf flares by constraining their size and
                location using short-period eclipsing binaries. With 20 second cadence we will be able to, for the first
                time, resolve the occultation of a flare with optical light. We can test if flares are equatorial, like
                on the Sun, or perhaps near the poles. This has implications for habitability and stellar physics.

              <div class="accordion-body">WASP-33b is a benchmark planet for studying hot Jupiters. The gas giant has
                been studied extensively for over a decade due to its excellent signal to noise (m_TESS=7.87) and
                because it is representative of many of the fascinating properties of hot Jupiters. However, the host
                star is a rapidly-rotating $\delta$ Scuti pulsator, which introduces complex additional signals into
                photometry and complicates parameter estimation. We therefore propose to independently test several key
                characteristics of WASP-33b by performing a joint transit and asteroseismic analysis using Cycle 5 data.
                Our analysis will yield improved constraints on the host star's bulk density, rotation rate, oblateness,
                inclination, and temperature, and will provide independent constraints on WASP-33b's nodal precession.

                65 K and M stars previously observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), to measure white-light flare
                rates. These stars range from pre-main sequence to field age stars and include members of the 40 Myr old
                Tuc-Hor association. By comparing how the UV and white-light flare rates change with age and testing
                whether white-light rates can accurately predict the flare behaviour in the UV, we will provide an
                insight into the contribution of flares to the UV environments of exoplanets, both young and old.

                However, professional facilities are limited to a few nights of observations, limiting analysis to small
                samples. In contrast, amateur astronomers can observe targets for weeks and can obtain photometry and
                spectroscopy simultaneously with TESS, allowing us to measure the temperatures and emission line
                energies of larger samples of white-light flares. We propose for 20-s cadence photometry of 9 active K
                and M stars that can be simultaneously observed by amateur astronomers, to study and characterise these
                energetic events. This target list will be made public for use by our team and the wider amateur

                cool stars spin down as they age. Models can be tested using stars of known age, but open clusters are
                biased towards young stars at only a few specific ages, while few field stars have accurate ages. We
                will use wide binaries to test gyro models, leveraging the requirement that models must yield the same
                age for both components of the binary. In support of this project, we will observe 2117 binaries which
                have previously been observed with TESS, making use of multiple epochs to increase the fraction for
                which Prot can be successfully measured and helping to decrease the incidence of period aliases.
                2-minute cadence will allow us to simultaneously examine flare activity levels as a function of age and
                rotation.

                flares with a special interest in the radiative loss of the energy in the visible domain of the
                electromagnetic spectrum. Moreover, our goal is to create a numerical model of flaring stellar

                including from TESS. The sometimes overlooked challenge is that low-mass stars flare frequently and at
                high amplitude. This not only hinders the detection and characterization of planets and stars, but it
                endangers any potential life. We propose a unique test of M-dwarf flares by constraining their size and
                location using short-period eclipsing binaries. With 20 second cadence we will be able to, for the first
                time, resolve the occultation of a flare with optical light. We can test if flares are equatorial, like
                on the Sun, or perhaps near the poles. This has implications for habitability and stellar physics.

                  young planets are critical, but radial velocity surveys of young systems are often overwhelmed by

                  aim to search for TTVs in 38 systems known to host young planets. Several already show TTVs or have

                implications from exoplanets to galaxies, an EB census is one of the key projects for TESS. Completed

                been observationally inaccessible owing to temporal undersampling at 30-minute cadence, save for a very
                select few red giants previously targeted at short cadence. The new availability of 200 second
                full-frame images (FFIs) now permits TESS to probe time-domain magnetic activity of essentially all
                visible RRRGs in a hitherto observationally inaccessible temporal regime. We propose to study this
                activity.

                absorbs in the stellar chromospheric emission lines. Thus the presence of hot, mass-losing planets
                depresses a star's apparent chromospheric emission. For intrinsically inactive stars, this effect
                suppresses the chromospheric emission to an impossibly low level. Our target FGK stars have been
                selected for their anomalously low chromospheric emission. We propose for 20s cadence light curves and

                increased cadence (4-6 times per day) using ASAS-SN. 2) We will spectroscopically classify all bright

                a census of stellar rotation in nearby (d<1000 pc) young (<1 Gyr) clusters, moving groups, and stellar
                  streams with the goal of determining when these tight sequences form, and how long stars remain
                  stalled, as a function of mass. We will use FFI data to extract light curves for ~12,500 stars spread
                  across dozens of coeval groups for this purpose, including 1050 stars in 9 group receiving their first
                  TESS data in C6. <br>

                investigating fundamental problems in contemporary astrophysics, such as the effects of rapid rotation
                on stellar evolution. In this project, we aim to measure the apsidal motion in binary systems in order
                to determine the oblateness of Be stars and infer their rotation rates. We will also analyze the
                residuals of the binary fit model to look for signals of stellar rotation, which will help us constrain
                the uncertainties of the inferred rotation rates.
