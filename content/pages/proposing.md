Title: Proposing to the TESS General Investigator program
template: slide
save_as: proposing.html

<!-- NASA's TESS is a space-based telescope that images large parts of the sky in the visible at a cadence of 2 minutes or less. TESS observes the same part of the sky continually for 28 days. The data is public, and includes precision photometry for tens of millions of sources.

TESS provides users with three different kinds of data products: <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess" target="_blank">Target Pixel Files (TPFs), Light Curves (LCs), and Full Frame Images (FFIs)</a>. The TPFs and LCs are provided for a subset of targets. These products have a shorter cadence, have background removed, and are corrected by the TESS pipeline, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016SPIE.9913E..3EJ/abstract" target="_blank">SPOC </a>.

TESS enables studies of exoplanet systems, single and multiple stars, supernovae, galaxies, and Solar System objects.  There are no reserved targets, no restricted science areas, and no proprietary period. All data is made available through MAST immediately after data processing and validation is complete. -->

The primary purpose of the TESS General Investigator (GI) Program is to enhance and maximize the science return from the mission. Users can obtain both data and funding through the TESS GI Program. The program facilitates and supports short-cadence observations with TESS as well as research undertaken with the Full-Frame Images.

Below you can find more information on the TESS General Investigator (GI) Program and how to propose for TESS data and research funding. The information is presented as a slideshow separated into sections for:
